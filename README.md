# CS287H-project

CS287H project on integrating human preferences into the generative design loop. The project is still in a very preliminary phase and utilizes only 2D image dataset rather than 3D engineering design datasets. Further iteration of this project to be announced...

To run this, you will need to do the following:
Upload the images to the Data directory, so there is something that the model can train on (ideally images for now..)

Install these following items to your environment:
PyTorch, torchvision, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, PySimpleGUI, PIL

To run the human preference model, you will need to run train_test2.py
